This is an implemetation of the following paper

W.Pan, Y. Yuan, J. Goncalves, and G.-B. Stan, 
A Sparse Bayesian Approach to the Identification of Nonlinear State-Space Systems, 
IEEE Transaction on Automatic Control, 2015 (to appear). arXiv:1408.3549
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3549

It should be noted that this is a vanilla implementation for demo purposes.
You have to download CVX toolbox from 
www.cvxr.com to use this code.

You can run run_main.m to start.

Efficient implementation will come soon!
