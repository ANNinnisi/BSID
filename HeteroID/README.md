==================== Quick Guide to Start ===========================

1. Install CVX toolbox from www.cvxr.com
2. Run 'start_up_cvx.m' for initilisation.
3. If you want to run a standalone demo, uncomment the fist line of script then excute RUN_MULTIPLE.m
4. If you want to reproduce the figures in the paper, comment the first few lines of RUN_MULTIPLE.m, then excute FigurePaperNoiseless.m for Figure 1 and FigurePaperNoise.m for Figure 2.
