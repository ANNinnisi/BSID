This folder contains the distributed implementation of the System Identification Algorithm which can be found for the "vanilla" version. The distributed implementation is based on the following paper

Boyd, Stephen, et al. "Distributed optimization and statistical learning via the alternating direction method of multipliers." Foundations and TrendsÂ® in Machine Learning 3.1 (2011): 1-122.

==================== quick guide to start ===========================

1. Download CVX toolbox from www.cvxr.com and run 'cvx_setup.m' to install the toolbox.
2. Run 'start_up.m' to the toolbox to your directory
3. RUN 'RUN_DistriID.m' and have fun!

============ guidience on the the use Parallel Computing Toolbox in Matlab =============== 
Use     
parpool(numberofcluster);
delete(gcp);
to start or delete multicluster

=============== Acknoledgement ===============
